# Project Name

HYBRID

# Project Description

HYBRID is an AI-powered assistant framework that uses Langchain, OpenAI APIs, and FAISS for vector search. It provides a modular agent system with tools such as web search, integrated into a Streamlit-based interface. Users can ask questions or execute tasks via the intelligent agent through a web UI.

# Target Platform

Web (via browser, hosted through Streamlit on Replit)

# Operating Environment

Online only (uses APIs and web search tools)

# Hosting Options

Default Replit hosting (Replit web app)

# Interface Style

- Functional and minimalist
- Streamlit-based UI
- Designed for interactive input/output with the AI agent

# Example Applications

- Langchain Agent Templates
- AI-powered Streamlit dashboards
- ChatGPT-style tools with web search (e.g., Perplexity)

# Expected Outputs

- Real-time responses to user input
- Integration of search results (via tools/search_tools.py)
- Execution traces or logs (via Langchain agents)

# Additional Features

- OpenAI LLM-based agent
- Langchain execution environment
- Vector memory using FAISS
- Modular tool-based system (easy to extend)
- Streamlit frontend

# Language Preferences

- Replit Agent interaction: English
- Application interface: English
